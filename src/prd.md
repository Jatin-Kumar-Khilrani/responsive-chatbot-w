- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Virtualization**: React Window for large message lists
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching with proper invalidation
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking, dynamic imports, and minimal dependencies

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Lightweight Components**: Custom lightweight components instead of heavy libraries
- **Shadcn Integration**: Selective use of shadcn components for complex UI patterns
- **Mobile-first Design**: Touch-friendly interfaces with proper hit targets
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for efficient layouts

## Implementation Considerations
- **Performance Budget**: Target <100kb initial bundle, <3s first contentful paint
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supporting feature additions
- **Deployment**: Optimized for GitHub Pages with proper routing and asset handling
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with graceful degradation

## Technical Architecture

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Route-based and component-based code splitting
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: For message lists to handle thousands of messages
3. **Memoization**: Strategic use of React.memo and useMemo
4. **State Management**: Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
5. **Asset Optimization**: Compressed images, optimized fonts, minimal CSS

### Scalability Features
1. **Modular Components**: Reusable, composable UI components
2. **Plugin Architecture**: Easy addition of new AI providers and features
3. **Configuration System**: Runtime configuration for different environments
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Network Issues**: Offline support with service workers
- **Large Message History**: Efficient pagination and virtualization
- **AI Service Failures**: Graceful degradation and error messages
- **Configuration Errors**: Validation and helpful error messages

## Reflection
