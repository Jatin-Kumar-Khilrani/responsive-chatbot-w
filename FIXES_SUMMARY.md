- Text no longer overlaps in settings panels
- Input fields are properly sized for mobile browsers
- Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (44px minimum)

### API Configuration
- All fields (endpoint, API key, model) are now fully editable
- Test connection functionality works for all providers
- Clear feedback for configuration status
- Proper validation with helpful error messages

### Error Recovery
- Enhanced error boundary with recovery options
- Better KV storage error handling with retries
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Clear user feedback for all error states

### GitHub Pages Deployment
- Proper SPA routing configuration
- Correct asset paths for subdirectory deployment
- Build process optimized for GitHub Pages
- Progressive Web App configuration

## Potential Remaining Issues

The 404 errors for KV storage (`/_spark/kv/`) suggest that:
1. The Spark runtime may not be fully initialized
2. The KV service might be starting asynchronously
3. Network connectivity issues during development

These are likely development environment issues that should resolve in production.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Testing**: Verify all touch interactions work properly
2. **API Configuration**: Test all provider types and connection scenarios  
3. **Offline Mode**: Test PWA functionality with service worker
4. **Error Recovery**: Test error boundary and recovery mechanisms
5. **GitHub Pages**: Verify deployment works with proper base paths

## Performance Optimizations

- Bundle splitting reduces initial load time
- Service worker provides offline capability
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized KV storage with retry mechanisms
- Proper caching headers for static assets
