## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a calming blue-orange palette to create focus areas while maintaining readability and professional appearance.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 230)) - Communicates trust and professionalism for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Gray (oklch(0.95 0.02 230)) - Supporting neutral background areas
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 50)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for developer controls and CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Blue #F8FAFC): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.1 230)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 7.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Card (Pure White): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Modern, technical typeface that conveys clarity and precision while remaining friendly - Inter provides excellent readability across devices and scales.

## Animations

Subtle functional animations that enhance usability without distraction - message send/receive should feel instant and satisfying, with gentle transitions for developer controls.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth message appearance conveys successful communication, control panel slides reinforce developer authority
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Message bubbles have priority, then control toggles, background elements remain static

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Dialog for settings, Card for messages, Button for actions, Input for text entry, Switch for developer mode, Badge for status indicators
- **Customizations**: Custom message bubble component with tail indicators, floating action button for mobile controls
